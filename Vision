            The Physical Asset
          </h3>
          <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
            You will not leave with 'notes'—you will leave with an audited, 12-month operational blueprint. This binder is the physical manifestation of your 2026 strategy, containing your specific milestones, your 'Direct Accountability' maps, and the financial triggers needed to hit your $100k+ profit pools. It is the only asset you'll need on your desk Monday morning.

            Boardroom Pods
          </h3>
          <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
            We've eliminated 'Networking.' In our Boardroom Pods, we use Collaborative Architecture to dismantle the specific friction points currently stalling your growth. These are closed-door, high-trust sessions where 5-6 peers act as your temporary Board of Directors. We don't swap business cards; we solve $100k problems in real-time.

            Faculty Council
          </h3>
          <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
            Direct, un-gated access to the 'Amazing 7 Faculty.' These are not keynote speakers who leave after the applause. These are world-class practitioners in AI Integration, High-Stakes Negotiation, and Human Capital. They are in the mansion with you, sitting at the dinner table, and auditing your Roadmap Binder to ensure your 2026 trajectory is mathematically sound.
